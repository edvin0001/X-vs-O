# X vs O 🎮

A clean, animated, and interactive remake of the classic Tic Tac Toe game — built using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🧩 Game Features

- 🎲 **Random Start**: Press the “Click to get a random choice” button to see who starts — X or O.
- ✍️ **Turn-based Logic**: Alternates turns visually using background color changes.
- 🧠 **Win Detection**: Recognizes wins across all rows, columns, and diagonals.
- 📢 **Toast Messages**: Displays animated win messages and invalid move alerts.
- 🔄 **Restart Button**: Resets the game board and score instantly.
- 🎨 **Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on all screen sizes.
